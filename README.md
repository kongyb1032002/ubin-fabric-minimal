# Project Ubin Phase 2 - Hyperledger Fabric

This repository contains the source code and test scripts for the Hyperledger Fabric prototype in Project Ubin Phase 2.

Ubin Phase 2 is a collaborative design and rapid prototyping project, exploring the use of Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT) for Real-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system. 
* Read the **Project Ubin Phase 2 Report** [here](http://bit.ly/ubin2017rpt)
* For more detailed documentation, refer to the Technical Reports: [Overview](https://github.com/project-ubin/ubin-docs/blob/master/UbinPhase2-Overview.pdf), [Hyperledger Fabric](https://github.com/project-ubin/ubin-docs/blob/master/UbinPhase2-Fabric.pdf) and [Testing](https://github.com/project-ubin/ubin-docs/blob/master/UbinPhase2-Testing.pdf)

The Fabric chaincode is written in Go and the API layer is written in JavaScript. All configurations and scripts are based on a 13 Virtual Machine setup (1 orderer, 1 central bank, 11 banks).

Additional notes:
* An external service (mock RTGS service) is to be deployed for Pledge and Redeem functions. It can be found in the [`ubin-ext-service`](https://github.com/project-ubin/ubin-ext-service)
* A common UI can be found in the [`ubin-ui`](https://github.com/project-ubin/ubin-ui) repository


## A. Getting Started

### Pre-requisites

This project is built and tested on the following:

- Operating System: Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS (64-bit)
- Docker: 17.09.0-ce
- Fabric: 1.0.1
- Go: 1.7.6
- Node JS: 6.9.5
- NPM: 3.10.10
- PM2: 2.7.2

To install all prerequisites, download and run the [setup script](fabric-setup.sh) provided in the root folder of this repository. Reboot the VM(s) after installation to ensure that all changes have taken effect.
    

### Installation

1. Clone or download the repository into `$GOPATH/src`
    ```
    cd $GOPATH/src
    git clone https://github.com/project-ubin/ubin-fabric.git
    ```

2. Install required NodeJS packages
    ```
    cd ubin-fabric/api
    npm install
    ```

3. Configure argument for NodeJS
    ```
    cd scripts
    cp ecosystem.config-template.js ecosystem.config.js
    ```
    Edit the `args` field in ecosystem.config.js to reflect the BIC assigned to the VM

    Default organisation names used for this prototype:

    | Hostname    | Organisation BIC |
    | ----------- | ---------------- |
    | FabricNx01  | *Orderer*        |
    | FabricNx02  | masgsgsg         |
    | FabricNx03  | bofasg2x         |
    | FabricNx04  | chassgsg         |

### Setting up cron jobs

1. Open up the cron table for editing
    ```
    crontab -e
    ```

2. Add the following line to the end of the file to trigger a 'keep-alive' transaction to all chaincode containers every 10 minutes:
    ```
    */10 * * * *  [ -f /var/tmp/croncontrol/fabric_ping ] || curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/ping -H 'content-type: application/json' -o $HOME/ping.log
    ```

3. On the MAS virtual machine, add the following line to enable a daily data reset at 2am:
    ```
    0 2 * * * curl -X PATCH http://localhost:8080/api/resetdata -H 'all: true' -H 'content-type: application/json' -o $HOME/reset.log
    ```


## B. Deployment

### Environment Configurations

All scripts executed during deployment are based on the assumption that each VM represents a different organisation

The VMs for banks will only contain:
- 1 Peer container
- 1 CA container
- 1 CouchDB container

While the VM for the orderer will only contain:
- 1 orderer container

Configurations and scripts assumes the VM hostnames are in the format of `FabricNx01`, `FabricNx02`, ..., `FabricNx013`. 

If the VM hostnames are named differently, change them accordingly in [`crypto-config.yaml`](network/crypto-config.yaml), [`docker-compose.yaml`](network/docker-compose.yaml
) and [`config.sh`](api/scripts/config.sh).

Prior to deployment, ensure that the following ports are opened between virtual machines:

| Port                         | Protocol | Usage                                      |
| ---------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| 7946                         | TCP/UDP  | Communication among nodes for docker swarm |
| 2377                         | TCP      | Cluster management communications          |
| 4789                         | UDP      | Overlay network traffic                    |
| 7050                         | TCP      | Orderer                                    |
| 7051, 8051, 9051, ..., 18051 | TCP      | Peer gRPC                                  |
| 7053, 8053, 9053, ..., 18053 | TCP      | Peer events                                |
| 7054, 8054, 9054, ..., 18054 | TCP      | CA Containers                              | 
| 5984, 6984, 7984, ..., 16984 | TCP      | CouchDB Containers                         | 



### Starting up the Fabric Network
The commands in this section should be executed in the [network](/network/) folder
```
cd $GOPATH/src/ubin-fabric/network
```

1. Start up docker swarm on the VM to be assigned as the orderer node (this will be the manager node)
    ```
    docker swarm init
    ```

    This will generate a command for joining the swarm as a worker node. Run this command on all worker nodes to join the swarm. 

    An example of the generated command is as follows:
    ```
    docker swarm join \
        --token SWMTKN-1-3pu6hszjas19xyp7ghgosyx9k8atbfcr8p2is99znpy26u2lkl-1awxwuwd3z9j1z3puu7rcgdbx \
        172.17.0.2:2377
    ```

2. Once all other nodes have joined the swarm, start the docker stack on the manager node
    ```
    docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yaml ubin
    ```

    Note: Once all the docker containers are created, it is recommended to wait for approximately 2 minutes before moving on to the next step

3. Create and join channels on the VM assigned as the central bank node
    ```
    ./channels.sh
    ```

    Once the central bank node has created and joined all channels. The other nodes can now join the Fabric network using the same command

### Initialising the API Layer and Chaincodes

Initialise the API and install all chaincodes on the 11 bank nodes
```
./init.sh
```

Once complete, run the same command on the central bank node to initialise the API, install and instantiate the chaincodes on all channels


## C. Chaincode Upgrade

The [upgrade script](api/scripts/upgrade.sh) will install and upgrade (if ran on central bank node) the specified chaincode(s)

Usage:
```
./upgrade.sh upgrade [-b] [-f] [-n] [-v version_number]

Options:
    -b | --bilateral    upgrades the bilateral channel chaincode
    -f | --funding      upgrades the funding channel chaincode
    -n | --netting      upgrades the netting channel chaincode
    -v | --version      requires the user to specify a version number (integer)
```

Example for upgrading bilateral and netting channel chaincodes to version 3:
```
cd $GOPATH/src/ubin-fabric/api
./upgrade.sh -b -n -v 3
```

Note:
- Running the upgrade script will update the version number in `cc_version.txt` in the `ubin-fabric/api/scripts` folder, which is meant to keep track the current chaincode version
- If version is not specified, the upgrade version will be corresponding to the number in `cc_version.txt`, incremented by 1

## D. Ubin External Service Setup

Ubin external service should be set up in the MAS Node (Nx02). This is a mock service of the current RTGS system, MEPS+. 

#### Build

1\. Clone the repository to the MAS node (FabricNx02)

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/project-ubin/ubin-ext-service.git
```
2\. Go to newly created folder

```sh
$ cd ubin-ext-service
```

3\. Build project using gradle

```sh
$ ./gradlew build
```
4\. Build artifact can be found at

    build/libs/MEPS-MockService-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

### Start External Service
1\. Update the `ubin-ext-service/application.properties` with Fabric configuration:

```sh
    PledgeURI=http://<host>:9001/api/fund/pledge
    RedeemURI=http://<host>:9001/api/fund/redeem
    Dlt=Fabric
```
    Note: Replace <host> with Central Bank (MAS) host/domain name.

2\. Copy built JAR artifact and properties files to the Central Bank VM
```sh
ubin-ext-service/build/libs/MEPS-MockService-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
ubin-ext-service/application.properties
```
Note: Ensure both files are in the same directory

3\. From Central Bank VM, start the mock service application
```sh
$ java -jar -Dspring.config.location=application.properties -Dserver.port=9001 MEPS-MockService-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

## E. Network Teardown

Bring down all docker containers, remove docker images, clean up enrollment materials and kill the API
```
cd $GOPATH/src/ubin-fabric/network
./network-down.sh
```

## F. Test Scripts

[Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) is the main testing tool used for this prototype. The Postman collection and environments are located in the [tests](tests/postman) folder in this repository. The API definitions can be found in the [Technical Report repository](https://github.com/project-ubin/ubin-docs/blob/master/api/UbinPhase2-FabricAPI.pdf).
